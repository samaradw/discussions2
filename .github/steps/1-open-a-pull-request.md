# Step 1: Setting Up GitHub Discussions ⚙️💬

## 📌 Objective  
Enable the Discussions feature on your repository so you can collaborate through posts and threads.

## 🧠 Why It Matters  
Before you can use GitHub Discussions, you need to enable the feature in your repo settings. This unlocks community Q&A, idea sharing, and more—all in one place.

## 🚀 Your Task  

1. Go to your repo (you’re already here).
2. Click on the **Settings** tab (top right, next to “Insights”).
3. In the left sidebar, scroll down to the **“Features”** section under **"Code and automation."**
4. Check the box for **✅ Discussions**.

Once you've done this, return to this repo and **make any small change** (like editing the README or pushing a dummy commit). That will unlock the next step!

✅ When you push to `main`, the skill will move on to **Step 2: Create a Discussion**.
